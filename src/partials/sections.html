        <p>
            Because no universal guidelines exist for how much debt state governments
            can afford, when policymakers try to assess how much borrowing to take on
            for projects such as roads, bridges, and schools, they often compare debt
            levels in their state to those of others. To make these comparisons, many
            policymakers evaluate how their state stacks up against geographic
            neighbors or other states with a common credit rating.
        </p>
        <p>
            But selecting a peer group based only on these traits overlooks many
            factors that influence borrowing levels. States with growing populations, for example, may wish to borrow more
            to ensure that their infrastructure adequately serves residents’ needs.
            Similarly, having a debt limit or other constraining budget policy can
            influence the share of borrowing taken on by state governments or
            localities.
        </p>
        <p>
            This interactive tool allows users to compare debt levels across more
            tailored peer groups, including comparing states with similar borrowing
            practices, constraints, and needs. The tool includes key measures that may
            influence borrowing levels, such as debt limit policies; the degree to
            which borrowing is conducted by the state itself, compared to component
            units such as independent agencies and authorities; and the division of
            borrowing between the state and local governments. The tool also includes
            traits that states more commonly consider when choosing peers, such as
            credit ratings and geographic proximity.

            In the <a class="pct-static-anchor" id="state-comparison" href="#section-comparison">“State comparison” section</a>, users can compare these data, including
            debt levels, for any two states, or any state to the U.S. median. In the
            section labeled <a class="pct-static-anchor" id="fifty-state" href="#section-states">“50-state data,”</a> users can sort and group all 50 states
            using multiple criteria, allowing users to identify groupings using a mix
            of measures. Information about the measures and the underlying data may be
            found in the <a class="pct-static-anchor" id="fifty-state" href="#section-about">“About the data” section</a> at the bottom of this page.
        </p>
        <p>
            States can use these data to select more appropriate peer groups, giving
            them a deeper understanding of how similarly positioned states manage their
            borrowing.

            The measures were selected based on evidence in the debt affordability and
            management literature that they relate to state debt levels, the
            feasibility of collecting the data, and a desire to avoid redundancy.<sup>1</sup> Pew also limited the
            number of measures to make the tool easy to use and understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            This tool is not intended to be an exhaustive catalog of the factors that
            might affect state borrowing levels. Instead, the tool is intended to help
            states consider relevant criteria when constructing peer groups.
        </p>

            Each measure is described below.

        <h3 class="js-debt_limit_type">
            General obligation debt limit type (2018)
        </h3>
        <p>
            General obligation (GO) debt is backed by a state’s full faith and credit,
            the strongest possible pledge. As a result, GO debt is typically a state’s
            highest rated and lowest cost form of debt.<sup>2</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            All but two states have legal GO debt limits, which vary in restrictiveness
            and structure. For example, Connecticut limits this debt to 1.6 times its
            total estimated general fund tax receipts, while Arizona effectively
            prohibits its issuance.<sup>3</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pew has classified each state’s limit for GO debt as one of the following
            types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Constitutional amendment.</strong>
                Three states—Alabama, Ohio, and West Virginia—require an amendment to
                their constitutions to issue GO debt.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Metric.</strong>
                In 11 states—Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, New
                Hampshire, North Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin—debt or
                annual debt service is not allowed to exceed a certain metric-based
                threshold. Tennessee, for example, caps debt service at 10 percent of
                combined revenues in its general, debt service, and highway funds.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Metric-based with referendum to exceed.</strong>
                North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming use a metric to cap debt but
                allow issuance above the cap with voter approval.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>No limit.</strong>
                Maryland and Vermont place no restrictions on GO debt.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Prohibition.</strong>
                Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, and Nebraska effectively prohibit GO debt.
                Indiana law forbids any GO debt to be issued; the others authorize
                amounts so low—$350,000 or less—as to be equivalent to prohibitions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Referendum and/or supermajority.</strong>
                Thirteen states—Alaska, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas,
                Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, and Rhode
                Island—require some combination of voter approval and/or a legislative
                supermajority (generally, three-fifths or two-thirds) to issue debt.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Referendum and/or supermajority and metric.</strong>
                Fourteen states—Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
                New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South
                Dakota, Texas, Virginia, and Washington—require a referendum and/or
                supermajority and have a metric-based cap on debt or debt service.

            Centralization (fiscal year 2014)
        </h3>
        <p>
            In some states, component units of government, such as independent agencies
            and authorities, conduct much of the borrowing, rather than the primary
            state government. Centralization measures primary government debt as a
            share of the total debt issued by the primary government and its component
            units. Across the states, centralization ranges from 0 percent—meaning that
            all borrowing is by entities other than the primary government—to 100
            percent, meaning the primary government does all of the borrowing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Component unit debt generally relies less on state general funds for
            repayment than primary government debt does. Often, lenders have no legal
            claim on state general funds if a component unit defaults. As a result,
            state comparisons based only on total debt may be misleading. Montana and
            Delaware, for example, have about the same total debt, but most of
            Montana’s debt is held by component units and most of Delaware’s is held by
            the state. When comparing measures of “total debt,” choosing peers based on
            the degree of centralization of debt may provide more appropriate
            comparisons.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> To calculate centralization in a state, Pew calculated primary
            government debt from states’ 2014 comprehensive annual financial reports.
            It then calculated debt held by major component units, as reported in their
            annual financial statements. Adding the two sums created a measure of
            “total debt,” from which the percentage held by the primary
            government—centralization—was determined.<sup>4</sup>

        </h3>
        <p>
            In some states, local governments are responsible for paying for most
            capital projects within their jurisdictions. In others, the state
            government is responsible for those projects, increasing its overall
            borrowing. The division of borrowing responsibility is related to the debt
            limit: In general, local governments in states with highly restrictive
            state debt limits have higher debt levels.<sup>5</sup> This measure compares
            local government borrowing to the combined debt held by the state and local
            governments. Higher numbers indicate a greater share of total debt is held
            by local governments. The state-local borrowing division ranges from 17.9
            percent to 88 percent.

            Revenue volatility (1998-2017)
        </h3>
        <p>
            Revenue volatility is the annual fluctuation in tax collections and is
            affected by several factors, including a state’s mix of tax streams. The
            score reflects the standard deviation of yearly percentage change in total
            tax revenue between 1998 and 2017.<sup>6</sup> Pew controlled for the
            effects of tax policy changes using the National Conference of State
            Legislatures’ State Tax Actions Report.
        </p>
        <p>
            A low volatility score means that revenue levels were similar from year to
            year, and a high score indicates that revenue grew or declined more
            dramatically. The scores range from 2.7 to 37.6. States with more volatile
            revenue face shared budget challenges. When revenues drop, fixed costs—such
            as debt service—may crowd out operating spending.<sup>7</sup>

            States compare their debt levels to peers through a variety of measures,
            including total outstanding debt and metrics that normalize debt levels by
            population or wealth to create a level scale across states of various
            sizes. Pew’s tool includes two ratios: debt per capita and debt as a
            percentage of state personal income. States often use a ratio of debt
            service to revenue when they evaluate debt levels and set limits. This
            ratio is not included in this tool due to cross-state comparability

                obligations held by component units, such as independent agencies and
                public authorities that “operate separately or somewhat autonomously from
                the central state government but where the state government maintains
                administrative or fiscal control over their activities.”<sup>10</sup> These measures are
                intended to capture a broad universe of debt related to state government

                self-supporting (debt paid for from specified pledged revenue) or component
                unit debt, to compare borrowing levels. Instead, these measures capture

                examinations of the breadth of state functions relying on debt
                financing. This definition may not be appropriate for all analyses.

            Debt per capita, which measures total debt against a state’s
            population, facilitates comparisons between states of different sizes.
            It also helps policymakers understand the debt burden on individual
            residents, who provide much of the revenue states use to repay debt in the
            form of taxes and user fees. The range of debt per capita is $870 to
            $11,059.

            Considering a state’s debt level relative to its available resources for
            repayment is a common practice used by states, credit rating agencies, and
            academics.<sup>11</sup> State

                    States do not use uniform definitions of debt service in their
                    comprehensive annual financial reports. Each reports debt service
                    from a unique combination of disparate funds. Using these sources
                    to create a comparable cross-state measure of debt service to
                    revenues is therefore difficult without a detailed understanding of
                    each state’s reporting practices. As a result, many cross-state
                    comparisons of debt service to revenues are inexact.
